"""Trained expert predictors for the MoE expert-offload prefetch path.

Prefetch METHODS are selected by `expert_predictor` in expert_offload_config:

    fate            the engine's built-in hash/gate next-layer predictor,
                    driven from the four MoE apply() sites
    mode2_har       trained head, predicts layer L from L's PRE-attention
                    residual (LAYER_DELTA=0)
    mode2_prevhfr   trained head, predicts layer L+1 from L's POST-attention
                    residual (LAYER_DELTA=1)

fate always keeps the targets a trained head does not cover: the hash-routed
layers (tid2eid[token_id] is exact and free), plus — for a layer-shifted atom —
the first covered MoE layer, whose predecessor was not in the training dump.

Head, normalisation and selection are transcribed from
moe_predictor_study_mode2_pa.py and must stay literal:
