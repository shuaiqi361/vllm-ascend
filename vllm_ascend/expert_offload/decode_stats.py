"""Decode-time statistics: MoE expert cache/prefetch accounting and
speculative-decoding acceptance, reduced to one end-of-run summary.

Design constraints this file is shaped by:

* The per-layer numbers are produced inside a ``_launch_host_func`` callback,
  which under ACL-graph replay re-executes with the argument tuple that was
  baked at capture time. Nothing per-step can be passed in as an argument, so
  the step boundary is *derived* here, from a layer being revisited.
* The callback may run on a report thread (one per subscribed stream), while
  the summary is printed from the main thread at shutdown. Every mutation is
  therefore under ``_lock``.
* Collection must add no device->host synchronisation. Everything recorded
  here is host data the paging path already holds.

class DecodeStatsCollector:
    """Aggregates per-(MoE layer, decode step) samples into a run summary.

    The hierarchy is deliberately two levels, not three: per-(layer, step)
    values are reduced across layers at step close into one scalar per metric
    per step, and the run summary is avg/median/min/max over that per-step
    series. min/max therefore read as "worst step / best step", which is the
    only reading that stays meaningful once layers are averaged out.

    What this collector does NOT know, and cannot detect from its inputs:

    * Whether expert pruning was enabled. If it was, the |G| handed to
      record_layer is the POST-prune routed set — pruning rewrites topk_ids in
      place, so the router's own selection no longer exists anywhere by the
      time these numbers are computed. hit_post / hit_pre / pred_acc are all
      measured against a demand set from which the misses have been removed, so
      a rising hit rate across two runs may be pruning getting more aggressive
      rather than paging getting better. Read `loads` and `pf_wait` for that:
      they count real transfers and real stalls.
    * That pred_acc (recall) and pred_prec (precision) move in OPPOSITE
      directions under pruning. Precision falls unconditionally; recall tends
      to rise but its sign is configuration-dependent. Neither alone says
      anything about the predictor — compare heads at a fixed
      experts_pruning_threshold and read the pair.
    * Whether anchor-union activation routing was enabled. If it was, |G| is
      the pool-constrained selection and the expert predictor is graded against
      a target distribution it was not trained on — so pred_prec and pf_useful
      fall, and pf_waste rises, for reasons unrelated to the head.
    * Whether padded rows are in the sample. Under activation routing padded
      rows keep role 0, which keeps them out of the candidate pool but does not
      mask their scores, so they route to a full top-k and their demand is
      inside |G| and `loads`. The SINGLE-CARD paging path applies no pad mask;
      only the multi-card callback drops pad rows (mc2_mask_h).

    _build_decode_stats_header in the model runner is where the run's feature
    flags get into the archived summary; keep the two in step.
